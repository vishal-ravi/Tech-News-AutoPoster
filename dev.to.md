# How to Obtain a Dev.to API Key

This guide will walk you through the steps to obtain an API key from Dev.to, which is required for posting articles programmatically using the Tech News AutoPoster.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Sign In to Dev.to

1. **Visit Dev.to**: Go to [Dev.to](https://dev.to/).
2. **Log In**: Click on the "Log in" button at the top-right corner of the page and log in with your existing account. If you don't have an account, click "Create account" and follow the registration process.

### 2. Navigate to Account Settings

1. **User Menu**: Once logged in, click on your profile picture or username at the top-right corner of the page to open the user menu.
2. **Settings**: In the user menu, click on "Settings."

### 3. Access the API Keys Section

1. **API**: In the left-hand menu of the Settings page, scroll down and find the "API" section.
2. **Generate API Key**: Click on "Generate API Key."

### 4. Generate a New API Key

1. **New API Key**: You will see a button labeled "Generate a new API Key." Click this button.
2. **Label (Optional)**: Optionally, you can provide a label for your API key to identify its purpose (e.g., "Tech News AutoPoster").
3. **Create API Key**: Click "Generate" to create your new API key.

### 5. Save Your API Key

1. **Copy API Key**: After generating the key, a string of characters will be displayed. This is your API key. **Copy it immediately**, as you won't be able to view it again once you navigate away from the page.
2. **Secure Storage**: Store your API key in a secure place. It's recommended to save it in your project's `.env` file for easy access and to keep it out of your source code.
